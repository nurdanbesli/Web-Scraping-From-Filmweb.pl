# WEB SCRAPING FROM FILMWEB.PL #

### INTRODUCTION ###

The focus of our web scraping project is to extract data from the film ranking section of the website filmweb.pl. Filmweb is a popular online platform that provides comprehensive information about movies, including rankings, reviews, and details about individual films. The film ranking page on filmweb.pl presents a curated list of movies based on various criteria such as popularity, user ratings, and reviews.  

Our goal is to gather data from this ranking section, which can be used for analysis, research, and other purposes. By scraping this web page, we can collect information about the films' titles, publication years, durations, rankings, and genres, enabling us to gain a deeper understanding of the film industry and trends. The specific webpage we target is located at https://www.filmweb.pl/ranking/film?fbclid=IwAR0qC8KuR4Z159TFqObUBnv3jETlH6yKX7tgtovXJqxrMRs3bG0veCpA4wQ. This webpage presents a ranking of the best movies from around the world. 

Our objective is to gather comprehensive data about the top 125 films listed on this webpage. We begin by scraping the links to these films' individual pages. By scraping data from these film pages, our aim is to collect specific information about each film, such as its title, publication year, duration, ranking, and genre. By combining web scraping techniques with the available data on filmweb.pl, we can gather information about the individual films and create a smaller dataset that provides a snapshot of the films' attributes.
